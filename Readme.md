ùùºScr -- New Scribble [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nuscr/nuscr.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nuscr/nuscr)
=====================

A toolkit to manipulate Scribble-style multiparty protocols, based on
classical multiparty session type theory. The toolkit provides means
to define global protocols, project to local protocols, convert local
protocols to a CFSM representation, and generate OCaml code for
protocol implementations.
